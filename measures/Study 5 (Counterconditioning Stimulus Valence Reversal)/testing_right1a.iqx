<page Relational_Testing_Instructions_1>
^^ We will now TEST what you learned earlier in the last part of the study.

^^ You will see an item at the top of the screen and a series of different response choice at the bottom. 

^^ ***You have to answer each question shown in the middle of the screen by clicking on the option at the bottom you think is correct.*** 

^^ This is a test: the computer will NOT tell you if you are correct or incorrect.

^^ So try to be as accurate as possible.
