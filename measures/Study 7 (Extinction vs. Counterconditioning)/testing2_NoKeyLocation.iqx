<page Relational_Testing_Instructions_1>
^^ We will now TEST what you learned earlier in the study. 

^^ You will see an item at the top of the screen and several options at the bottom. 

^^ ***You have to click on the option you think is correct.*** 

^^ This is a test: the computer will NOT tell you if you are correct or incorrect.

^^ So try to be as accurate as possible.
