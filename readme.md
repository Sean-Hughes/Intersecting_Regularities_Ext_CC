# Intersecting Regularities (Extinction & Counterconditioning)




## Notes on project structure

Ian tends to structure the directories in a project using the following convention:

```
+-- experiment 1
		+-- analysis
		+-- data
		+-- measures
+-- experiment 2
		+-- analysis
		+-- data
		+-- measures
+-- experiment 3
		+-- analysis
		+-- data
		+-- measures
+-- meta-analysis
		+-- analysis
```

This project is currently formatted the other way around:

```

+-- analysis
		+-- Experiment 1
		+-- Experiment 2
		+-- Experiment 3
		+-- meta-analysis
+-- data
		+-- Experiment 1
		+-- Experiment 2
		+-- Experiment 3
+-- measures
		+-- Experiment 1
		+-- Experiment 2
		+-- Experiment 3
```

I'll leave it this way for the moment, but just FYI that there are differences in conventions.



##Â To do list

- Eventually remove redundant manually processed spss files
- Integrate Sean's data processing code
- Ian to code review Sean's data processing code
- There is one participant in Study 1 (training 1) with duplicate data. Figure out what do with this (retain them?). Without further action they will likely be excluded.
